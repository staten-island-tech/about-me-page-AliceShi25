    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Alice. Nice to meet you. I don't know what to say. I'm 16, I
      like cats, and this was made for educational purposes. Send help. In
      elementary school, my teachers would tell me that a paragraph is 5 to 9
      sentences, so as long as I'm within that range, that should be good
      enough. I'm suppose to write about myself but what is there to write? I
      don't usually do much. On weekdays I do schoolwork and on weekends I do
      prep work. I like to go on walks when I have the time.
    </p>
